      <p>Sustainability is becoming more and more important by the day. With the delcared climate emergency, we have no choice now but to make changes to our everyday routines. For some people becoming vegan or vegetarian is viable- and that is admirable! I have been vegetarian for about 5 years now and I am slowly transitioning to veganism</p>
<p>It varies from town to town, which is why I want to do a little breakdown for Leeds students. Our recycling facilities are quite poor in Hyde Park and Headingly, but I believe this is due to previous students disintrests in doing things properly. Firstly, make sure whatever you are recycling is rinsed and clean, glass or plastic that is dirty or greasy is not recycled so make sure you rinse it under the sink for 10 seconds.</p>
